# SlidifyPresentation

This repo houses the code and examples accompanying the [presentation to the Davis R-Users Group on 6/6/16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An6HwO8ZVmw).

The spreadsheet I mention re: contrasting the attributes of each R Presentation framework can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vTWtDWmL4sRJhpv5JDVjit7lng0TLEFdSoqtPCX9l4Q/edit?usp=sharing).  Please feel free to contribute any of your own experience/knowledge with these frameworks to it!
